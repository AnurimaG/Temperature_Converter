# Temperature_Converter

* This is a simple Temperature converter Fron Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa .
* In this I have used total **three methods** .
                                           * 1st is Celcius To Fahrenheit converter methods . 
                                           * 2nd is Fahrenheit to Celsius converter method .
                                           * 3rd is the Main method from where main execution of the program will be done .
* In this program I have also used Inheritance which is a concept of **OOPS ( Object Oriented Programming Language).**
* So basically in the Converter file there are two methods which is the **Parent class** .
* In the Temperature_Converter file is the main method and is the **child class** which inherits the methods from Parents Class .
